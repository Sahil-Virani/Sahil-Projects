## About Me

I am a junior at Stevens Institute of Technology, majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Quantitative Finance. I am passionate about AI, machine learning, and software development as well as the stock market and market analysis. I enjoy working on projects that challenge my problem-solving skills and allow me to learn new technologies.

## Projects

### Project 1: Stock Market Prediction Model
- **Description:** Designed and implemented an LSTM neural network model in Python using Keras and TensorFlow to predict stock prices.
- **Technologies Used:** Python, Keras, TensorFlow, Yahoo Finance API, Matplotlib
- **Repository Link:** [Link to repository]

### Project 2: Trivia Game Application
- **Description:** Developed a network-based multiplayer Trivia Game in C, implementing both server and client functionalities.
- **Technologies Used:** C, Socket Programming, Multiplexed I/O
- **Repository Link:** [Link to repository]

### Project 3: Custom Shell
- **Description:** Developed a custom shell in C, implementing built-in commands, color printing for prompts, signal handling, and fork/exec for external commands.
- **Technologies Used:** C
- **Link:** [[Minishell]](https://github.com/Sahil-Virani/Sahil-Projects/blob/main/minishell.c)

### Project 4: Fake News Detector
- **Description:** Developed a TfidfVectorizer on my dataset using sklearn. Afterwards, initialized a PassiveAggressive Classifier and fitted the model. Finally, the accuracy score and the confusion matrix revealed how well my model performed.
- **Technologies used:** Python, Pandas, NumPy
- **Link:** [[Fake News Detector]](https://github.com/Sahil-Virani/Sahil-Projects/blob/main/FakeNewsDetector.ipynb)
#### Dataset
- **Filename:** [news.zip](https://github.com/Sahil-Virani/Sahil-Projects/blob/main/news.zip)
- **Description:** A compressed version of the news.csv dataset containing labeled real and fake news articles.
